# SEGGER emUSB-Host for ModusToolbox Release Notes

Please refer to the [README.md](./README.md) and the [emUSB-Host API Reference Guide](https://infineon.github.io/emusb-host/html/index.html) for a complete description of the emUSB-Host Middleware.

## What's Included?

* Bug fixing

To view the full list of changes, refer to [Changelog section](https://infineon.github.io/emusb-host/html/index.html#section_emusb_host_changelog).

## Known Issues and Limitations

The Host suspend and resume for CAT1A devices do not work because the controller cannot generate the correct signaling on the USB bus.

Possible workarounds include:
- Reset the device with the USB application. For example:
```
USBH_URB Urb;
Urb.Header.Function = USBH_FUNCTION_RESET_DEVICE;
USBH_SubmitUrb(USBH_CDC_GetInterfaceHandle(CDC_Handle), &Urb);
USBH_CDC_Close(CDC_Handle);
```
- Physically unplug the device, and then plug it back in.
