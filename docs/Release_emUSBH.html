            <li>MSD: Module refactored. Multiple buffers and unnecessary alloc/free operations removed. TestUnitReady command is now sent alongside of data transmissions instead of via a timer. This slightly improves performance.</li>
            <li>MSD: Removed BulkOnlyErrorRecovery support, this feature only caused problems as it re-enumerated the device and expected the application to work with the old handle. This has been replaced by a simple reset, when an MSC device misbehaves it is reset and the user receives a removal and an add notification.</li>
            <li>MSD: Changed module to allow devices without storage media to be added successfully (e.g. empty SD card reader). Media can be connected to the device at a later time.</li>
            <li>Printer: Module refactored. Adding/removing devices to the module is now handled similarly to the other class modules, via reference counters and timers.</li>

            <li>Renesas driver: Setup requests and FIFO access did not work on big endian CPUs. Fixed.</li>

            <li>MSD: USBH_MSD_GetUnits could return an incorrect number of units. Fixed.</li>
            <li>MSD: During the data phase a zero length packet would cause the module to wait for the read timeout and would consider it to be an error, which is not correct in some cases. Fixed.</li>
            <li>KinetisFS: Check for short packets during the setup data phase was invalid, this would cause devices with any requested descriptor longer than the device&#39;s endpoint zero MaxPacketSize to fail enumeration. Fixed.</li>

          <ol>
            <li>OHCI: Improved control and bulk EP removal. Previously endpoint lists would be halted for EP removal which could block a new URB from executing for a short time. In cases where an URB is started from inside a timer routine (like in the MSD class) the URB would always timeout because the endpoint list was disabled and could not be re-enable as it was also done from inside a timer. With this version endpoint lists are no longer halted during removal.</li>

            <li>EHCI: Time for USB reset was sometimes not long enough. Fixed.</li>
            <li>EHCI: USBH_Task may enter busy loop after 0x7FFFFFFF ms (~24.8 days) from system start-up, giving lower priority tasks no chance to run. Fixed.</li>
            <li>CDC: USBH_CDC_ClrRts() did not work. Fixed.Program correction: CDC: Sending control line state could dereference a NULL pointer resulting in a crash. (Affected API was USBH_CDC_SetDtr, USBH_CDC_ClrDtr, USBH_CDC_SetRts, USBH_CDC_ClrRts, USBH_CDC_SetBreakOn, USBH_CDC_SetBreakOff, USBH_CDC_SetBreak). Fixed.</li>
            <li>OHCI: Interval time for interrupt endpoints was always set to 32ms regardless of the value set by the device. Fixed.</li>
            <li>OHCI: When a URB was canceled the next consecutive URB on the same endpoint could start with the wrong data toggle value. Fixed.</li>
            <li>KinetisFS: When an URB was started, but it could not be completely initialized because the stack was out of memory the pendingURB pointer was not set to NULL, which could cause a crash later on as the stack would try to abort the invalid URB.</li>

          <h3>Improvements</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>CDC: Improved read speed with USBH_CDC_Read when the user is providing a buffer which is a multiple of MaxPacketSize.</li>

        <div>
          <h3>New Features</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>STM32F7xx: Added support STM32F7xx full speed controller.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Improvements</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>STM32 HS/STM32F1 FS/OHCI/KinetisFS: Code reworked with a multitude of improvements to stability.</li>
            <li>Memory module: New memory management for lower memory usage.</li>
            <li>HUB support: Changed determining the MaxPacketSize for device that are initially enumerated.</li>
            <li>HUB support: Reduced the number of AddEndpoint and ReleaseEndpoint calls.</li>
            <li>OHCI: Added zero-copy support. Zero-copy is usable when the OHCI controller has full access to the transfer RAM and the device does not use cache.</li>
            <li>CDC/FT232/HID: User callbacks (set via USBH_*_RegisterNotification) are no longer called for devices which did not pass initialisation phase (e.g. device was removed during initialisation).</li>
            <li>HID: Events are no longer allocated during GetReport/SetReport, but are allocated one at HID_Open and freed at HID_Close. This improves performance.</li>
            <li>CDC: Added USBH_CDC_SendEncapsulatedCommand and USBH_CDC_GetEncapsulatedResponse. These functions are not documented yet in this release.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Program corrections</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>EHCI driver: USB channel was not stopped correctly when releasing an interrupt endpoint. Fixed.</li>
            <li>EHCI driver: Interval parameter in interrupt endpoint descriptor was not considered correctly. Fixed.</li>
            <li>HUB support: Errors on HUB ports were not handled correctly. Fixed.</li>
            <li>HID: InputReportSize/OutputReportSize (retrieved via USBH_HID_GetDeviceInfo) were not set. Fixed.</li>
            <li>HID: Fixed an issue where the user callback function pointers were only initialized when async was used. (otherwise when not using async the old value was used (NULL or a function pointer to an async routine)).</li>
            <li>CDC: USBH_CDC_Write - pNumBytesWritten was not set correctly. Fixed.</li>

          <h3>New Features</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>EHCI: Added support for MCUs with cache.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Improvements</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>General: Changed USBH_GetNumDevicesConnected to work with HCIndex.</li>
            <li>General: Class modules and generic code reworked to handle disconnection of devices and stack de-initialisation better. Eliminated the possibility of device objects not being removed when the stack is de-initialised.</li>
            <li>General: Removed serial number from USBH_INTERFACE_INFO struct. Added new function USBH_GetInterfaceSerial().</li>
            <li>General: Abort URBs are now always allowed through even if the device was removed (otherwise URBs could potentially remain pending forever).</li>
            <li>General: Moved utility functions from core and class modules into a new file - USBH_Util.c</li>
            <li>CDC: Allowed reading NULL packet with USBH_CDC_Read(). Added MaxPacketSize to CDC_DEVICE_INFO structure.</li>
            <li>CDC: Return value of USBH_GetInterfaceDescriptor is now checked (caused an infinite loop when it was not checked and the function failed).</li>
            <li>CDC: Fixed length check in the interrupt IN completion routine (caused serial state updates to fail).</li>
            <li>CDC: Fixed a potential issue with _AbortEP, it was potentially possible for it to be stuck while waiting for a completed event. _AbortEP no longer waits for anything, the RemovalTimer restarts itself as long as the endpoint has a non-zero ref count.</li>
            <li>CDC: Updated module to support any ACM protocol.</li>
            <li>Memory module: _Size2Index did not take MIN_BLOCK_SIZE_SHIFT into account. Fixed.</li>
            <li>EHCI/OHCI/STM32 FS: Code reworked with a multitude of improvements to stability.</li>
            <li>CDC/FT232/MTP/MSD: Reworked to free device instances only from one spot (from the removal timer).</li>
            <li>CDC/FT232/MTP/MSD: Where possible replaced USBH_MALLOC with USBH_TRY_MALLOC so that panic is not reported in debug builds, instead USBH_STATUS_RESOURCES is reported to the upper layer(s).</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Program corrections</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>General: Host controller module could pass the virtual memory pointer to the free routine instead of the physical address. Fixed.</li>
            <li>General: When a transfer memory pool was not set USBH_Free would try to free any passed address. Fixed.</li>
            <li>CDC: USBH_CDC_ReadAsync() InUse was set wrongly. Fixed.</li>
            <li>CDC: bRxCarrier and bTxCarrier were swapped. Fixed.</li>
            <li>HUB: pEnumDevice and RefCounter were not set back correctly in error cases. This could cause an infinite loop. Fixed.</li>
            <li>MSD: If the initialisation of the MSD device failed it was possible to receive a removal notification for the device without a previous add notification. Fixed.</li>

          <h3>New Features</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>General: Added the function USBH_SetOnSetPortPower() which allows to register a user callback through which the user is notified when port power is being enabled or disabled.</li>
            <li>MSD: Added the function USBH_MSD_SetAheadBuffer() which allows to set your own buffer for the MSD read-ahead cache functionality.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Improvements</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>General: When a driver is removed all ports which are handled by the driver are now turned off.</li>
            <li>General: Sample applications no longer use the printf function and use USBH_Logf_Application instead. This has the advantage that all outputs can be configured in one place (USBH_ConfigIO.c)</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Program corrections</h3>

            <li>MTP: Added functions USBH_MTP_CheckLock() and USBH_MTP_SetEventCallback().</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Improvements</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>MSD: The read-ahead cache is no longer a static buffer, but is allocated from the assigned emUSB-Host memory</li>
            <li>General: Declared the driver API structures as const. This helps save a bit of RAM.</li>
            <li>General: When there are no more instances available for a specific class a panic error is no longer issued, now a warning is issued instead.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Program corrections</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Core: When emUSB-Host is being de-initialized via USBH_Exit() it was possible for emUSB-Host to hang in certain conditions. Fixed.</li>
            <li>CDC: It was possible for a reference counter to not be decremented when an endpoint was aborted, it could lead to the device reference remaining in memory even after it was removed. Fixed.</li>
            <li>FreeRTOS layer: Did not work properly with multiple host controllers. Fixed.</li>
            <li>EHCI: When disconnecting a hub which has devices connected to it a re-enumeration would not work. Fixed.</li>
            <li>Hub module: When the timing between connecting and reconnecting a hub with connected devices was short enough it was possible for a device instance to remain in memory. Fixed.</li>
            <li>MSD: The GetMaxLUN command returned an incorrect value when the MSD interface was not the first interface in a device.</li>
            <li>STM32F2xx FS: Communication could break down when the device sends NAKs for a prolonged period of time. Fixed.</li>
            <li>STM32F2xx FS: Fixed an issue (or rather a problem with the hardware) where when an URB was open and a device disconnected from the host the controller did not always produce a channel halted interrupt when the corresponding channels were halted which would lead to emUSB-Host leaving the device object with a positive refcount which in turn would lead to memory never being freed and made it impossible to de-initialize the host. Now a driver callback function handles this and completes all aborted URBs.</li>
